#### This is a list of features that have/have not been integrated in SceneBuilder

As I said in the past, my dream on the subject is one day to make a super better alternative to SceneBuilder.
Unfortunately, until that day comes, I'll have to stick to what we have.

#### Integrated

- [x] SceneBuilder detection system
- [x] Theme Support. **Partial** at the moment since the theme API is in development

#### Not Integrated

- [ ] Ability to customize ripple generators (can still be done via CSS)
- [ ] Ability to set icons in controls that support it (e.g. FABs, can be done programmatically in the FXML)
- [ ] Ability to set variants (it can be done by adding the variant' style class in the properties inspector)
